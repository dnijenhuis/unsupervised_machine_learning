34463149~Validity and Reliability of the French Short Version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS).~To develop a French Short Version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (Fr-sQOD) to assess the quality of life impairments of patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD). Patients with OD and controls were enrolled from 2 academic centers. Individuals completed the Fr-sQOD, an OD visual analog scale severity, and the French version of the sinonasal outcome tool-22 (SNOT-22). Cronbach α was used to measure the internal consistency of Fr-sQOD. The reliability and the external validity of Fr-sQOD were assessed through a test-retest approach and by correlating Fr-sQOD with SNOT-22 scores, respectively. The external validity was assessed by correlation analysis between Fr-sQOD and the result of an assessment of the severity of OD on a visual analog scale. Eighty patients completed the evaluations. The internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach α .96), and the test-retest reliability was high in the entire cohort (rs = 0.877, P < .001). The correlation between Fr-sQOD total scores and the severity of OD was moderate but significant (rs = -0.431; P = .001) supporting an acceptable external validity. Patients with OD had a significantly higher score of Fr-sQOD than healthy individuals (P < .001), indicating a high internal validity. The Fr-sQOD is a reliable and valid self-administered tool in the evaluation of the impact of OD on quality of life of French-speaking patients.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34463151~A Preliminary Report on the Correlation Between Nasal Function and the Different Phases of the Nasal Cycle.~To explore whether the different phases of the nasal cycle have a significant effect on nasal temperature, the nasal mucosal clearance rate, and levels of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) and to investigate the correlation between these nasal conditions. The study participants were divided into 2 groups: the control group and the rhinitis group. The participants' nasal temperature, cilia clearance rate, and nNO levels were measured during different phases of the nasal cycle (the congestion phase and decongestion phase) in the control group and before and after undergoing inferior turbinate ablation in the rhinitis group. The temperature of the nasal cavity in the control group was significantly higher in the congestion phase than in the decongestion phase (P = .0025), while in the rhinitis group, the temperature of the nasal cavity decreased significantly after inferior turbinate ablation (P = .001). In the control group, the nasal mucosa clearance time was significantly shorter in the congestion phase than in the decongestion phase (P = .001), and in the rhinitis group, the clearance time of the nasal mucosa was significantly shortened after the operation (P = .0025). In the control group, the levels of nNO were significantly higher in the congestion phase than in the decongestion phase (P = .025), while in the rhinitis group, nNO levels decreased significantly after the operation (P = .005). The function of the nasal cavity changes in different phases of the nasal cycle. Therefore, when evaluating the impact of various factors on nasal function, factors associated with the nasal cycle should also be considered. Inferior turbinate plasma ablation can improve the ciliary function of the nasal mucosa, reduce the temperature of the nasal cavity, and reduce nNO levels.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34463595~Robotic-assisted stereotactic drainage of cerebral abscess and placement of ventriculostomy.~Robotic surgery has found increasing use in multiple subfields of neurosurgery. While the initial applications of stereotactic robotic surgery were for the placement of electrodes for extra-operative seizure monitoring, this technique has become increasingly relevant in other areas of neurosurgery. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of successful robotic surgery utilization to drain a cerebral abscess and place an external ventricular drain. The authors demonstrate a novel use for stereotactic robotic assistance to drain a cerebral abscess and place ventriculostomy in a 74-year-old female patient who presented with a left basal ganglia Streptococcus intermedius abscess and concomitant ventriculitis. Drainage of a deep-seated abscess and placement of ventriculostomy was successfully performed in this patient without intraoperative difficulties or complications. The total operative time, including registration was 64 minutes and the estimated blood loss was 25 mL. The patient recovered well and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on postoperative day 19. The use of robotic surgery to drain cerebral abscesses and place ventriculostomies is technically feasible and may potentially decrease operative time and increase accuracy and safety.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34464164~Treatment of Postinfectious Olfactory Dysfunction Using Corticosteroids.~This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of different doses and forms of corticosteroids in the treatment of postinfectious olfactory dysfunction and to specify the factors related to the curative effects. The medical records of patients diagnosed with postinfectious olfactory dysfunction from January 2018 to May 2019 were reviewed. All patients received different doses of oral corticosteroids for 12 days or inhaled corticosteroids for 1 month. A review of the records of 43 patients showed that the mean follow-up time was 6.66 months, and the overall effective rate of treatment was 48.8%. Postinfectious olfactory dysfunction exhibited distinct seasonality, with the highest incidence in March. The curative effect was significantly related to the olfactory discrimination threshold at the first consultation (P = .022), but not significantly associated with age (P = .325), sex (P = .924), duration of disease (P = .526), follow-up time (P = .489), or treatment program (P = .330). Different doses and forms of corticosteroids showed no significant difference in the therapeutic effect on postinfectious olfactory dysfunction. The olfactory discrimination threshold at the first consultation was the most important factor influencing the prognosis.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34464165~Clinical Characteristics of Older Adults Seeking Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.~Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with numerous clinical correlates. Although effective treatments abound, patient acceptance and adherence is low. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) is a surgical treatment alternative for the treatment of OSA; however, the demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals seeking HNS are not well categorized. This study sought to determine the clinical characteristics of older adults seeking HNS for the treatment of OSA. Self-report questionnaires were administered to all patients older than 50 years seeking a HNS consultation at a large university medical center. Questionnaires included validated National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) measures of physical functioning, sleep-related impairment, cognitive abilities, depression, anxiety, and anger along with the Information extracted from electronic medical records included age, sex, race, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Patients included 113 adults (mean age 63.30 years, 57% male, 79% white) with severe OSA (AHI = 33.91, standard deviation = 20.63). Overall, 88% of patients reported elevated insomnia symptoms, 30% reported mild difficulty with physical functioning, and 36% indicated that they had experienced moderate-severe daytime impairments attributed to poor sleep. Additionally, we found 28% of sampled individuals reported moderate-severe depressive symptomology, over 19% reported moderate-severe anxiety, and over 17% reported moderate to severe anger issues. Approximately, 38% of the sample reported moderate to severe cognitive difficulties. The aim of the study was to better understand the clinical characteristics of older patients with OSA seeking HNS treatment. Utilizing NIH PROMIS questionnaires, we identified unique clinical and psychosocial correlates in this sample, which included higher rates of insomnia symptoms, physical dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and depressive symptoms than the general population. Future studies will be needed to investigate these relationships more thoroughly and throughout the course of the treatment.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml

34465479~Prevalence of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Professional Voice Users.~Objectives To determine the prevalence and specific modalities of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by professional voice users (PVUs) for vocal ailments and to examine the PVU's health care utilization. Methods A Canadian national cross-sectional survey was conducted. Surveys were distributed electronically to members of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists; the National Association of Teachers of Singing; the Canadian Actors Equity Association; and the Department of Vocal Performance at Western University. Participants were asked about the products/therapies they use to improve vocal health. Frequency of use, health care utilization, and general influencers in treatment choice were also collected. Results Two hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. 86% of participants claimed to have taken at least one form of CAM when experiencing voice loss or a negative voice change. Of the respondents, 18% claimed to use products/therapies for vocal health routinely in the absence of vocal ailments. The most common CAMs used were hot drinks with honey and/or lemon, lozenges, and inhaling steam. When vocally ill, PVUs were significantly more likely to use CAMs than any other treatment method. Voice teachers and medical doctors most commonly influenced the choice of the treatment. Conclusion This study illustrated the substantial prevalence of CAMs in the PVU community. Understanding the utilization of CAMs can help clinicians navigate treatment strategies for this patient population.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34465480~Self-Perceived Voice Handicap During COVID19 Compulsory Facemask Use: A Comparative Study Between Portuguese and Spanish Speakers.~This study investigates self-perceptions of voice-related handicap as a function of facemask use in the general working population during the COVID19 outbreak, using the Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Each VHI item was answered twice in a row; the first answer referred to the condition of not wearing a facemask (henceforth, the Without condition) and the second to the condition of using a facemask (henceforth, the With condition). VHI scores were collected via Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, California), targeting 2 groups of speakers of different nationalities, Portuguese (n = 261) and Spanish (n = 297). A Wilcoxon test was carried out to compare VHI scores between With and Without conditions for each group of speakers; a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups within each condition. Results suggested that VHI overall scores and scores for all dimensions were higher for the With condition, for both Portuguese and Spanish speakers. When comparing groups of speakers, Spanish speakers presented higher scores for functional and emotional dimensions, for both With and Without conditions. In addition, the overall score for the Without condition was higher for Spanish speakers. No differences between groups were found for the total VHI score for the With condition. When comparing overall VHIdiff between speakers, that is, the difference in the VHI total score between With and Without conditions, no significant differences could be found. Thus, a multiple regression analysis was carried out between the VHIdiff and the independent variables of interest: age, sex, smoking habits, professional occupation, nationality, facemask type and its hours of use. The resulting model providing the highest association suggested that 2.5% of the variation in overall VHIdiff total score could be associated with sex, smoking habits, and professional level. Female smokers who use their voices during prolonged hours at work (e.g., teachers, lawyers, sales people) presented a higher VHI total score when wearing a mask. Future voice-related health interventions should address preventive strategies towards speaking behaviors leading to vocal fatigue and vocal effort as a consequence of compulsory facemask use, especially with respect to female professional voice users who smoke.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34467793~COVID-19: Post-vaccine Smell and Taste Disorders: Report of 6 Cases.~Post-vaccine olfactory and gustatory disorders are very rare and were reported in patients who received influenza vaccines. In this article, we report 6 cases of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine olfactory and gustatory disorders in patients with negative nasal swabs. Precisely, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were reported in 5 and 1 patients, respectively. Sense disorders occurred after the first injection of AstraZeneca (n = 4) or the second injection of Pfizer (n = 2) vaccines. In 4 cases, the olfactory or gustatory disorder was confirmed with psychophysical evaluations. The duration of chemosensory dysfunction ranged from 4 to 42 days. None of the patient reported mid- or long-term olfactory or gustatory disorder. The occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in adults benefiting from COVID-19 vaccines is still rare but has to be known by otolaryngologists.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
34467797~A Novel Concept for Surgical Management of a Traumatic Comminuted Cricoid Fracture.~The cricoid plays 2 key roles: phonation and maintenance of the airway frame, both of which are lost in cases of comminuted cricoid fractures. The management of these 2 functions becomes a challenge in planning surgical treatment. We report the treatment course in a case of traumatic comminuted cricoid fracture that was resolved with good airway and phonatory functions. A 25-year-old man fell down the stairs and complained of respiratory discomfort and hoarseness of voice. A computed tomography scan showed comminuted cricoid fracture; therefore, surgery was performed to restore the patient's airway and phonation functions. We found that the airway was maintained by the anterior part and that the phonation depended on the posterior part of the cricoid. This novel concept helped clarify the treatment goal in this case of comminuted cricoid fractures. Furthermore, it is important that the anterior part of the cricoid is reconstructed with sufficient internal diameter, while the posterior part of the cricoid is reconstructed in the correct position.~2024~pubmed25n1100.xml
